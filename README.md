# Altino Library

Altino is a car that uses an Arduino interface to controll it. This is an unnoficial repository. I created it because there seemed to be no open source repository for the altino car.

## Instructions

* Open your Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
* In the search bar type in "altino"
* It should be the first one. Install it.
* Add "#include <Altino.h>" to the top of your arduino file.
